### 6. Data Exploration

The background of the slide is a photograph of a large, modern, multi-story indoor atrium. The space features high ceilings, concrete support columns, and walls lined with vertical wooden slats. Large glass windows at the far end look out onto a body of water. The ground floor is populated with people sitting at various tables and desks, suggesting a study or common area in a university setting.

# Introduction to Data Exploration

* Data exploration broadly classified into two types—descriptive statistics and data visualization.
    - Descriptive statistics is the process of condensing key characteristics of the dataset into simple numeric metrics.
    - Visualization is the process of projecting the data, or parts of it, into multi-dimensional space or abstract images.
* Data exploration helps with
    - Understanding data better, to prepare the data in a way that makes advanced analysis possible,
    - Get the necessary insights from the data faster than using advanced analytical techniques.
* Data exploration provides
    - A set of tools to obtain fundamental understanding of a dataset.
    - Grasping the structure of the data, the distribution of the values, and the presence of extreme values and the interrelationships between the attributes in the dataset.
    - Guidance on applying the right kind of further statistical and data science treatment

# Object of Data Exploration

* Data understanding
    - Provides a high-level overview of each attribute (also called variable) in the dataset and the interaction between the attributes.
    - Answers the questions like what is the typical value of an attribute or how much do the data points differ from the typical value, or presence of extreme values.
* Data preparation
    - Dataset has to be prepared for handling any of the anomalies that may be present in the data including outliers, missing values, or highly correlated attributes.
    - Some data mining algorithms do not work well when input attributes are correlated with each other. Thus, correlated attributes need to be identified and removed
* Data mining tasks
    - Basic data exploration can sometimes substitute the entire data mining process. For example, scatterplots can identify clusters in low-dimensional data or can help develop regression or classification models with simple visual rules.
* Interpreting the results
    - Finally, data exploration is used in understanding the prediction, classification, and clustering of the results of the data mining process.
    - Histograms help to comprehend the distribution of the attribute and can also be useful for visualizing numeric prediction, error rate estimation, etc.

# Datasets

* The most popular datasets used to learn data science is probably the **Iris** dataset, introduced by Ronald Fisher, in his seminal work on discriminant analysis.
* The **Iris** dataset contains 150 observations of three different species, *setosa*, *virginica*, and *versicolor*, with 50 observations each.
* Each observation consists of four attributes: *sepal length*, *sepal width*, *petal length*, and *petal width*. The fifth attribute, the *label*, is the name of the species observed.

The image shows a photograph of a purple iris flower with annotations identifying the physical characteristics measured in the dataset:
- **Sepal width**: indicated by a line across the width of one of the outer flower parts (sepals).
- **Sepal length**: indicated by a line along the length of a sepal.
- **Petal length**: indicated by a line along the length of one of the inner flower parts (petals).
- **Petal width**: indicated by a line across the width of a petal.

# Datasets

* All four attributes in the **Iris** dataset are numeric continuous values measured in centimeters.
* One of the species, *setosa*, can be easily distinguished from the other two using simple rules like the petal length is less than 2.5 cm.
* Separating the *virginica* and *versicolor* classes requires more complex rules that involve more attributes.

# Datasets

* Data types
    - Data come in different formats and types. Understanding the properties of each attribute or feature provides information about what kind of operations can be performed on that attribute.
    - For example, the temperature in weather data can be expressed as any of the following formats:
        - Numeric (31°C, 34°C) or Fahrenheit (101°F, 104°F).
        - Ordered labels as in hot, mild, or cold.
        - Number of days within a year below 0°C (10 days in a year below freezing).

# Datasets

* Categorical or Nominal
    - Categorical data types are attributes treated as distinct symbols or just names. The color of the iris of the human eye is a categorical data type because it takes a value like black, green, blue, gray, etc.
    - There is no direct relationship among the data values, and hence, mathematical operators except the logical or "is equal" operator cannot be applied. They are also called a nominal or polynominal data type, derived from the Latin word for name
    - An ordered nominal data type is a special case of a categorical data type where there is some kind of order among the values. An example of an ordered data type is temperature expressed as hot, mild, cold

# Descriptive Statistics

* Descriptive statistics refers to the study of the aggregate quantities of a dataset.
* Some examples of descriptive statistics include average annual income, median home price in a neighborhood, range of credit scores of a population, etc.

# Univariate Descriptive Statistics

* Univariate data exploration denotes analysis of one attribute at a time. This technique only can be used for understanding the separate attributes without the connection with the other attributes.
* Measure of Central Tendency
    - The objective of finding the central location of an attribute is to quantify the dataset with one central or most common number.
    - Mean: The mean is the arithmetic average of all observations in the dataset.
    - Median: The median is the value of the central point in the distribution.
    - Mode: The mode is the most frequently occurring observation.
* Measure of Spread
    - Range: The range is the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value of the attribute.
    - Deviation: The variance and standard deviation measures the spread, by considering all the values of the attribute. Deviation is simply measured as the difference between any given value ($x_i$) and the mean of the sample ($\mu$).

# Multivariate Descriptive Statistics

* Multivariate exploration is the study of more than one attribute in the dataset simultaneously.
* This technique is critical to understanding the relationship between the attributes, which is central to data science methods.

# Multivariate Descriptive Statistics

* Central Data Point
    * In the Iris dataset, each data point as a set of all the four attributes can be expressed:
        - observation $i$: {sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width}
    * For example, observation one: {5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2}. This observation point can also be expressed in four-dimensional Cartesian coordinates.
    * For the Iris dataset, the central mean point is {5.006, 3.418, 1.464, 0.244}.

# Multivariate Descriptive Statistics

* Correlation
    - Correlation measures the statistical relationship between two attributes, particularly dependence of one attribute on another attribute.
    - When two attributes are highly correlated with each other, they both vary at the same rate with each other either in the same or in opposite directions.
    - Correlation between two attributes is commonly measured by the Pearson correlation coefficient ($$r$$), $$-1 \le r \le 1$$, which measures the strength of linear dependence.
    - A value closer to 1 or -1 indicates the two attributes are highly correlated, with perfect correlation at 1 or -1. A correlation value of 0 means there is no linear relationship between two attributes.

# Multivariate Descriptive Statistics

* Correlation
    * The Pearson correlation coefficient between two attributes x and y is calculated with the formula:

$$r_{xy} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2 \sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y})^2}} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{N \times s_x \times s_y}$$

    where $s_x$ and $s_y$ are the standard deviations of random variables $x$ and $y$, respectively.

The following table describes the two scatter plots illustrating correlation:

# Data Visualization

* Visualizing data is one of the most important techniques of data discovery and exploration.
* The visual representation of data provides easy comprehension of complex data with multiple attributes and their underlying relationships.
* The motivation for using data visualization includes:
    - Comprehension of dense information.
    - Relationships.

# Data Visualization

* Univariate Visualization
    - Histogram: a histogram is one of the most basic visualization techniques to understand the frequency of the occurrence of values.
    - Quartile: a box whisker plot is a simple visual way of showing the distribution of a continuous variable with information such as quartiles, median, and outliers,
    - Distribution Chart: for continuous numeric attributes like petal length, instead of visualizing the actual data in the sample, its normal distribution function can be visualized instead.

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma} e^{-(x-\mu)^2/2\sigma^2}$$

where $\mu$ is the mean of the distribution and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the distribution.

# Data Visualization

## Multivariate Visualization

* **Scatterplot:** in a scatterplot, the data points are marked in Cartesian space with attributes of the dataset aligned with the coordinates.
* **Scatter multiple:** a scatter multiple is an enhanced form of a simple scatterplot where more than two dimensions can be included in the chart and studied simultaneously.
* **Scatter Matrix:** a scatter matrix solves this need by comparing all combinations of attributes with individual scatterplots and arranging these plots in a matrix.
* **Bubble Chart:** a bubble chart is a variation of a simple scatterplot with the addition of one more attribute, which is used to determine the size of the data point.
* **Density Chart:** density charts are similar to the scatterplots, with one more dimension included as a background color.

# Data Visualization

* Visualizing High-Dimensional Data
    - **Parallel Chart:** a parallel chart visualizes a data point quite innovatively by transforming or projecting multi-dimensional data into a two-dimensional chart medium.
    - **Deviation Chart:** a deviation chart is very similar to a parallel chart, as it has parallel axes for all the attributes on the x-axis.
    - **Andrews Curves:** an Andrews plot belongs to a family of visualization techniques where the high-dimensional data are projected into a vector space so that each data point takes the form of a line or curve.

# Data Visualization

## Visualizing High-Dimensional Data

* Parallel coordinates plot each feature on a separate column.
* Each feature is then connected by lines, for each data sample.
* Again, colormap can be used to choose an assortment of colors.

```python
from pandas.tools.plotting import parallel_coordinates
parallel_coordinates(iris.drop("Id", axis=1), "Species", colormap='cool')
plt.show()
```

The following table represents the approximate data ranges shown in the parallel coordinates plot for the Iris dataset:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Species</th>
        <th>SepalLengthCm</th>
        <th>SepalWidthCm</th>
        <th>PetalLengthCm</th>
        <th>PetalWidthCm</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>Iris-setosa</td>
<td>4.3 - 5.8</td>
<td>2.3 - 4.4</td>
<td>1.0 - 1.9</td>
<td>0.1 - 0.6</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
        <td>Iris-versicolor</td>
<td>4.9 - 7.0</td>
<td>2.0 - 3.4</td>
<td>3.0 - 5.1</td>
<td>1.0 - 1.8</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
        <td>Iris-virginica</td>
<td>4.9 - 7.9</td>
<td>2.2 - 3.8</td>
<td>4.5 - 6.9</td>
<td>1.4 - 2.5</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The plot shows four vertical axes representing the features: SepalLengthCm, SepalWidthCm, PetalLengthCm, and PetalWidthCm. Each line represents a single observation, colored by its species:
- **Iris-setosa**: Cyan lines, generally characterized by lower petal length and width.
- **Iris-versicolor**: Light purple lines, occupying middle ranges for petal measurements.
- **Iris-virginica**: Magenta lines, generally having the highest petal length and width values.

# Visualizing High-Dimensional Data

The image shows an Andrews plot (Fig. 3.17) for the Iris dataset. It consists of multiple overlapping wave-like curves in three colors, each representing a different species:
- **Iris virginica**: Represented by red curves.
- **Iris versicolor**: Represented by green curves.
- **Iris setosa**: Represented by blue curves.

An *Andrews plot* belongs to a family of visualization techniques where the high-dimensional data are projected into a vector space so that each data point takes the form of a line or curve. In an Andrews plot, each data point $X$ with $d$ dimensions, $X = (x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_d)$, takes the form of a Fourier series:

$$f_x(t) = \frac{x_1}{\sqrt{2}} + x_2\sin(t) + x_3\cos(t) + x_4\sin(2t) + x_5\cos(2t) + \dots \tag{3.4}$$

This function is plotted for $-\pi < t < \pi$ for each data point. Andrews plots are useful to determine if there are any outliers in the data and to identify potential patterns within the data points (Fig. 3.17). If two data points are similar, then the curves for the data points are closer to each other. If curves are far apart and belong to different classes, then this information can be used classify the data (Garcia-Osorio & Fyfe, 2005).
