# Data Exploration Process

## Data Exploration Process

- Organize the Dataset
- Find Central Points
- Understand Attribute Spread
- Visualize Distributions
- Pivot the Data
- Detect Outliers
- Analyze Relationships
- Visualize High-Dimensional Data

## Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Data Exploration Process | A structured sequence of steps used to understand the structure, distribution, and relationships in a dataset. |
| Central Point | The typical or representative value of an attribute, usually measured using the mean or median. |
| Spread | How widely values of an attribute vary around the central point. |
| Outlier | An extreme data value that is very different from most other observations. |
| Pivoting | Reorganizing data to analyze it from different perspectives. |
| High-Dimensional Data | Data with many attributes (dimensions) that cannot be easily visualized in simple 2D plots. |

## Overview

The slides define data exploration as a **step-by-step analytical workflow**.

Each step reveals more structure about the dataset and prepares it for further statistical or data-mining analysis.

## Step-by-Step Data Exploration Process

### 1. Organize the Dataset

The first step is to prepare and organize the data into a structured format so that:

- Attributes (columns)
- Observations (rows)

can be analyzed consistently.

---

### 2. Find Central Points

For each attribute, a **central point** is calculated to represent a typical value.

This is usually done using:

- Mean
- Median
- Mode

This gives a reference for what is considered “normal” in the data.

---

### 3. Understand Attribute Spread

The spread shows how much values vary from the center.

The slides imply this is measured using:

- Range
- Variance
- Standard deviation

Large spread means high variability, small spread means data is tightly grouped.

---

### 4. Visualize Distributions

Each attribute’s distribution is visualized using:

- Histograms
- Box plots

This reveals:

- Skewness
- Clusters
- Outliers

---

### 5. Pivot the Data

Pivoting reorganizes the dataset to:

- Compare subsets
- Examine patterns across groups

This allows the same data to be viewed from different perspectives.

---

### 6. Detect Outliers

Outliers are extreme values that differ strongly from the rest of the data.

Visualization and statistics help identify:

- Data errors
- Rare events
- Special cases

---

### 7. Analyze Relationships

This step studies how attributes depend on each other.

Scatterplots and correlation measures are used to detect:

- Trends
- Dependencies
- Clusters

---

### 8. Visualize High-Dimensional Data

When many attributes exist, specialized visualizations are used:

- Parallel coordinates
- Andrews curves
- Deviation charts

These reveal patterns that cannot be seen in 2D plots.

## Summary

The Data Exploration Process transforms raw data into:

- Structured understanding
- Statistical summaries
- Visual insight

It provides the foundation for **reliable data mining and machine learning**.
