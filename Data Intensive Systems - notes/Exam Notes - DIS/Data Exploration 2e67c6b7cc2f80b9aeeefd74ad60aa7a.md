# Data Exploration – Master Term Definitions

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Data Exploration | The process of obtaining a fundamental understanding of a dataset by analyzing its structure, distributions, extreme values, and relationships using descriptive statistics and visualization. |
| Descriptive Statistics | The process of summarizing a dataset using numerical measures such as mean, median, variance, and standard deviation. |
| Data Visualization | The process of projecting data into graphical or visual forms to reveal patterns, trends, and relationships. |
| Dataset | A collection of observations where each observation consists of multiple attributes and possibly a label. |
| Attribute | A variable or feature describing a property of a data point (e.g., sepal length). |
| Label | The target or class of a data point (e.g., the Iris species). |
| Continuous Numeric Data | Data that can take any real value within a range and supports arithmetic operations. |
| Categorical (Nominal) Data | Data consisting of names or categories with no numeric or ordering relationship between values. |
| Ordered Nominal (Ordinal) Data | A categorical data type where values have a natural order but no measurable distance between them. |
| Data Understanding | The process of obtaining a high-level overview of attributes, their typical values, and their distributions. |
| Data Preparation | Identifying and handling anomalies such as missing values, outliers, and correlated attributes before analysis. |
| Data Mining Tasks | The use of exploration to detect patterns such as clusters, trends, or class boundaries in data. |
| Interpreting Results | Using statistics and visualization to understand and validate the outputs of data mining. |
| Mean | The arithmetic average of all values in an attribute. |
| Median | The middle value of a sorted dataset. |
| Mode | The most frequently occurring value. |
| Range | The difference between the maximum and minimum values of an attribute. |
| Variance | A measure of how much values deviate from the mean. |
| Standard Deviation | The square root of variance, representing typical distance from the mean. |
| Symmetry | Whether a distribution is balanced around its center. |
| Skewness | The degree to which a distribution leans left or right. |
| Kurtosis | The degree to which a distribution has heavy or light tails. |
| Univariate Statistics | Analysis of one attribute at a time. |
| Multivariate Statistics | Analysis of multiple attributes simultaneously to study relationships. |
| Correlation | A measure of the statistical relationship between two attributes. |
| Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r) | A value between –1 and 1 that measures the strength and direction of linear dependence between two attributes. |
| Histogram | A chart that shows how numeric data is distributed across value ranges (bins). |
| Box Plot | A chart showing median, quartiles, range, and outliers of an attribute. |
| Scatterplot | A plot showing the relationship between two numeric attributes. |
| Scatter Matrix | A grid of scatterplots comparing all attribute pairs. |
| Bubble Chart | A scatterplot where bubble size represents an additional attribute. |
| Density Chart | A scatterplot with color-coded density to show concentration of data points. |
| Parallel Coordinates | A visualization where each attribute is an axis and each data point is a line across them. |
| Deviation Chart | A parallel-axis visualization that highlights deviations of values across attributes. |
| Andrews Curves | A method that converts high-dimensional data points into curves to reveal structure and outliers. |
| Central Point | The representative or typical value of an attribute, usually the mean or median. |
| Spread | How much values of an attribute vary around the center. |
| Outlier | An extreme value that deviates strongly from the rest of the data. |
| Pivoting | Reorganizing data to analyze it from different perspectives. |
| High-Dimensional Data | Data containing many attributes that cannot be easily visualized in two dimensions. |
| Data Exploration Process | A step-by-step workflow for organizing data, analyzing distributions, detecting outliers, and understanding relationships between attributes. |
